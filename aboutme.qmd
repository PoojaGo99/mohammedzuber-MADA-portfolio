## Background and Training

Hello! My name is **Mohammed Zuber**, and I am currently a second year Ph.D. student in **Pharmaceutical Health Services, Outcomes, and Policy** at the **University of Georgia**. I hold a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree from **Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, India**. My journey in healthcare and outcomes research has been fueled by my passion for improving patient care through evidence-based solutions.

## Professional Experience

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a **Global Health Outcomes Scientist** at **Eli Lilly India**, where I contributed to: Conducting **systematic literature reviews** and **network meta-analyses**. Supporting **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** for oncology therapies. Developing **AMCP dossiers** for oncology products in **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia**, **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer**, and **Breast Cancer**.

This experience strengthened my expertise in health economics, outcomes research, and pharmacoepidemiology.

## Research Interests

My research interests include the following areas:

1.  **Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR):** Understanding the economic implications of healthcare interventions and their impact on patient outcomes.

2.  **Health Technology Assessment (HTA):** Evaluating the clinical, economic, and social value of health technologies to inform decision-making.

3.  **Pharmacoepidemiologic Research:** Investigating the real-world use, safety, and effectiveness of medications using large healthcare databases such as MarketScan and SEER.

4.  **Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis:** Synthesizing evidence from multiple studies to provide actionable insights for clinical and policy decisions.

5.  **Evidence-Based Medicine:** Integrating clinical expertise with the best available evidence to improve patient care.

## Programming and Analytical Skills

I have prior experience in the following tools and platforms:

**Statistical Analysis**: SAS, R, and STATA.

**Data Management**: MarketScan, and DistillerSR.

## What I Hope to Learn

Through this course, I aim to:

1.  Enhance my **data visualization** skills using modern tools like Quarto.

2.  Improve my ability to create **reproducible research outputs**.

## A Fun Fact About Me

I love playing field hockey and was honored to captain my university's hockey team at the **All India University South Zone Championship**. Balancing academics and sports taught me resilience and teamwork.

## A Cool Resource

I highly recommend exploring this resource:

1.  **Cochrane Handbook: Network Meta-Analysis**\
    This chapter explains the methods and utility of network meta-analysis, which estimates the relative effects of multiple interventions and provides a ranking hierarchy. It’s an essential read for anyone interested in systematic reviews and meta-analysis.\
    [Read the Cochrane Handbook chapter](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-11#:~:text=Network%20meta%2Danalysis%20produces%20estimates,ranking%20and%20hierarchy%20of%20interventions.)
