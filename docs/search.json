    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/mz13171/Downloads/MADA-course/mohammedzuber-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

Similarly being single was associated with a decrease of 37.37 cm in height compared to the divorced(p-value: 0.010). However being married was associated with an increase of 10.56 cm in height compared to divorced which was not statistically significant(p-value: 0.10).\nFigure 1 shows a boxplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Height by marital status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot shows the distribution of height across different marital status groups.Individuals who are married have highest median height with less variability.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/mz13171/Downloads/MADA-course/mohammedzuber-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

Larger population might be associated with better healthcare infrastructure, economic growth, and development, leading to higher life expectancy.However, some small countries still exhibit high life expectancy, indicating that factors like healthcare access and living conditions play a crucial role beyond population size.\n\n# Create scatterplot \nggplot(variabletwo, aes(x = log(population), y = life_expectancy)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"purple\", alpha = 0.7) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Scatterplot of Life Expectancy vs Population Size\",\n    x = \"Population Size (Log Scale)\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Table 1: Summary of missing values for infant mortality\n\n# Calculating the number of missing values for infant mortality by year\nmissing_data &lt;- africadata %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize( missing_infant_mortality = sum(is.na(infant_mortality)), \n    total_observations = n(), #this will gives us the total observations\n  )\n\n# printing the result \nprint(missing_data)\n\n# A tibble: 57 × 3\n    year missing_infant_mortality total_observations\n   &lt;int&gt;

Whereas high infants mortality rates are associated with lower life expectancy, possibly due to poor healthcare access, malnutrition, and economic hardships.\n\n# Create scatterplot life expectancy as a function of infant mortality\nggplot(variableone, aes(x = log(infant_mortality), y = life_expectancy)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"green\", alpha = 0.7) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Scatterplot of Life Expectancy vs Infant Mortality\",\n    x = \"Infant Mortality\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Figure 2: Scatterplot of Life Expectancy vs Population Size\nThe scatterplot depicts the relationship between life expectancy and population size. There is some positive correlation between population size and life expectancy, but it is not strongly linear. Larger population might be associated with better healthcare infrastructure, economic growth, and development, leading to higher life expectancy.However, some small countries still exhibit high life expectancy, indicating that factors like healthcare access and living conditions play a crucial role beyond population size.\n\n# Create scatterplot \nggplot(variabletwo, aes(x = log(population), y = life_expectancy)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"purple\", alpha = 0.7) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Scatterplot of Life Expectancy vs Population Size\",\n    x = \"Population Size (Log Scale)\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Table 1: Summary of missing values for infant mortality\n\n# Calculating the number of missing values for infant mortality by year\nmissing_data &lt;- africadata %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize( missing_infant_mortality = sum(is.na(infant_mortality)), \n    total_observations = n(), #this will gives us the total observations\n  )\n\n# printing the result \nprint(missing_data)\n\n# A tibble: 57 × 3\n    year missing_infant_mortality total_observations\n   &lt;int&gt;
